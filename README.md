## Gain visibility into your system in minutes without any code changes

Coroot is an open-source eBPF-based observability tool that turns telemetry data into actionable insights,
helping you identify and resolve application issues quickly.

## Features

### Zero-instrumentation observability

* Metrics, logs, traces, and profiles are gathered automatically by using eBPF
* Coroot provides you with a Service Map that covers 100% of your system with no blind spots
* Predefined inspections audit each application without any configuration

</p>

### Built-in expertise

* Coroot can automatically identify over 80% of issues
* If an app is not meeting its Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Coroot will send a single alert that includes the results of all relevant inspections
* You can easily adjust any inspection for a particular application or an entire project

### Grasp insights from logs with just a quick glance

* Coroot turns terabytes of logs into just a few dozen metrics by extracting repeated patterns right on the node
* Works for any type of applications, including Kubernetes, Docker/Containerd, AWS RDS, or non-containerized apps
* No configuration required

</p>

### Profile any application in 1 click

* Analyze any unexpected spike in CPU or memory usage down to the precise line of code
* Don't make assumptions, know exactly what the resources were spent on
* Easily investigate any anomaly by comparing it to the system's baseline behavior

### Deployment Tracking

* Coroot discovers and monitors every application rollout in your Kubernetes cluster
* Requires no integration with your CI/CD pipeline
* Each release is automatically compared with the previous one, so you'll never miss even the slightest performance degradation
* With integrated Cost Monitoring, developers can track how each change affects their cloud bill
